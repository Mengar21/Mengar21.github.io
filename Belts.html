Below are the belt levels used at our Taekwondo school. However, many Taekwondo school have their own belt levels and color systems so please check with your Taekwondo instructor.</p>

			<li>Sixth Dan</li>
			<li>Seventh Dan</li>
			<li>Eighth Dan</li>
			<li>Ninth Dan</li>
			<h3>When And How?</h3>
			<p>Students generally have a color belt test every 3 months (until they reach the higher color belt levels). They will be tested for knowledge of and their skill in specific forms, kicks, breaks and self-defense techniques. Moreover, other schools also test students on additional subject matters (i.e. Taekwondo history and terminology). 
				<br><br>Please see your Taekwondo instructor to learn what will be tested at your school for your next belt test. After achieving a black belt, it takes more and more time to achive the next belt.E.G to go from First Dan to Secoond Dan you must wait at lease 2 year, to go from Seccond Dan to Third Dan you must wait at least 3 years. And the pattern continues. 
				<br><br>Remember that many Taekwondo schools use different color belt systems so the color belt system above is just a sample of what you might find if you join a Taekwondo school.</p>
			<h3>Black Belt Levels – Time to achieve these belts can vary at different schools.</h3>

<li>1st Degree/Dan Black Belt – This initial Taekwondo black belt takes about 3-4 years to earn (after passing all of the color belt tests and a black belt test)</li>
<li>2nd Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 2-3 years to earn.</li>
<li>3rd Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 3-4 years to earn.</li>
<li>4th Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 4-5 years to earn.</li>
<li>5th Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 5-6 years to earn.</li>
<li>6th Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 6-7 years to earn.</li>
<li>7th Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 7-8 years to earn.</li>
<li>8th Degree/Dan Black Belt – Generally 8-9 years to earn.</li>
<li>9th Degree/9th Dan Black Belt – If you reach this level, you are a Taekwondo Grand Master. This is generally the highest belt level in the WTF Taekwondo system awarded to “living” people.</li>
			<h3>Other Taekwondo Schools – Color Belt Rank Variations</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, many Taekwondo schools use different color schemes. You will need to check with your instructor to see what color belts are offered at your school and what techniques & forms are associated with your color belts.</p>

<p>Here are some different color schemes used at other TKD schools:</p>
